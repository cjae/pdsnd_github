### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project utilizes Python for the exploration of data provided by Motivate, a prominent bike share system provider operating in numerous major U.S. cities. The primary objective is to uncover patterns in bike share usage, with a focus on comparing usage patterns in three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Key Statistics Analyzed

1. **Popular Times of Travel** (i.e., when bike rides most frequently commence):
   - Most common month for bike rides
   - Most common day of the week for bike rides
   - Most common hour of the day for bike rides

2. **Popular Stations and Trips**:
   - Most commonly used starting station
   - Most commonly used ending station
   - Most frequently taken trip route (i.e., the combination of start and end stations that occurs most frequently)

3. **Trip Duration**:
   - Total travel time across all bike rides
   - Average travel time for bike rides

4. **User Information Analysis**:
   - Count of each user type
   - Count of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
   - Earliest, most recent, and most common birth years (only available for NYC and Chicago)
